        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Line a square pan with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare your flax egg by combining your ground flaxseed with your brewed (chilled) coffee. Let it sit for 10 minutes, to form a gel.</li>
            <li>In a microwave-safe bowl or stovetop, melt one cup of chocolate chips of choice. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add your vegan butter and coconut sugar, and whisk well. Add in your prepared flax eggs, melted chocolate, vanilla, and almond extract, and mix well, until glossy.</li>
            <li>Sift through your flour, baking powder, salt, and cocoa powder and mix until just combined. Do not overmix. Fold through the remaining chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Transfer your brownie batter into the lined pan. Bake your brownies for 27-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove brownies from the oven and let cool completely, before slicing into 12 pieces.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add your flour, baking soda and salt and mix well. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate mixing bowl, add your softened butter, sugar, and brown sugar. Beat together until smooth and creamy. Add in your vanilla extract and mix well.</li>
            <li>Slowly add your flour mixture, and mix until just combined. Fold through your chocolate chips. If the dough is a little crumbly, add the milk, one tablespoon at a time. 
            Only add the milk as needed. If your dough is firm and formable, do not add any.</li>
            <li>Cover the cookie dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. This will ensure the cookies do not spread, and remain thick.</li>
            <li>Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Once warm, form 6 balls of cookie dough and place on a cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges go slightly brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes on the sheet, before transferring to a wire rack until cool.</li>
        </ol>
