    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose gluten free flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup vegan butter softened, not melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate chips of choice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add your flour, baking soda and salt and mix well. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate mixing bowl, add your softened butter, sugar, and brown sugar. Beat together until smooth and creamy. Add in your vanilla extract and mix well.</li>
        <li>Slowly add your flour mixture, and mix until just combined. Fold through your chocolate chips. If the dough is a little crumbly, add the milk, one tablespoon at a time. 
        Only add the milk as needed. If your dough is firm and formable, do not add any.</li>
        <li>Cover the cookie dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. This will ensure the cookies do not spread, and remain thick.</li>
        <li>Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Once warm, form 6 balls of cookie dough and place on a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges go slightly brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes on the sheet, before transferring to a wire rack until cool.</li>
    </ol>
